\section{Intro}

This is the file in which you should put documentation of anything
that has been fixed in EB Chombo.

\begin{itemize}

\item{4-24-2009}  EBConductivityOp single vs. multi cylinder seem to
  get different answers.   example/EBAMRPoissonOp/condExec using
  single.inputs and multi.inputs.   The output was doing something
  funny.  They get the same answers but they were not converging.
  This was fixed when the ebstencil call got put into the same form as
  EBAMRPoissonOp.  Also, BiCGStab seems to work much better than
  EBSimpleSolver in this case.
  

\item Read/write EBIS was wrong because of a problem with multivalued
cells at a box boundary.   Linearization is a cell-centered semantic
and therefore we have to do the same dance with irregular faces that
we did for copy.   Problem seems to be fixed. 

\end{itemize}
