#
# This file is input for chombo_utils.py, when called by src_makemakefile_am.py.
# The first column is the name of a directory under lib/src.  Subsequent columns
# are the names of libraries (built under lib/src) to which we need to link the
# library defined in the directory named by the first column.
# Directory names in columns after column 1 are expanded according
# to the dependencies listed for them in earlier lines.  So make sure you
# don't list any "forward dependencies".
#
# This file, and what we do with it, is only necessary when building in a
# --disable-shared configuration.  (But even when we're using shared libraries,
# it doesn't hurt.)
