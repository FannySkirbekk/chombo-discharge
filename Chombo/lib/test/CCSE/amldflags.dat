# This file is input for makemakefile_am.py.  The first column is the name
# of a directory under lib/test.  Subsequent columns are the names of
# libraries (built under lib/srs) to which we need to link the tests in that
# directory.  Directory names in columns after column 1 are expanded according
# to the dependencies listed for them in earlier lines.  (So make sure you
# don't list any "forward dependencies".)
