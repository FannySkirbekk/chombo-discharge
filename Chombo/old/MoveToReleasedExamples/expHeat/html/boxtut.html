<h1>  BoxTools Examples </h1>
<p>
We present the same application done three different ways
to illustrate how  Chombo can be used to make applications.
We have implemented an explicit heat equation solver 
with single-grid only implementation, a very basic
domain-decomposition method, and a method that uses 
all the relevant Chombo tools.

To compile any of these examples, go into the 
appropriate directory and edit GNUmakefile.  The single line
you have to change is the first line which  looks like:
<pre>
<font face="Courier">
CHOMBO_HOME = /home/graves/users/graves/_anag/_dev/Chombo/lib
</font>
</pre>
Change the variable CHOMBO_HOME to the directory name where
you have installed Chombo.   Then, in your shell, type "make".
This will produce an executable of the form "heat(some other stuff).ex".
The executable takes no arguments.  Just run it by typing its name
in your shell.

<p>
The <a href="singleGridHeat.html"> single-grid version</a> is given
here.   This only uses the IntVect, Box, and FArrayBox classes
of Chombo.
<p>
The <a href="domCompHeat.html"> domain decomposition version</a> is given
here.   In this version, the Fortran interface is still done
manually as is  the processor mapping.
<p>

The <a href="slickHeat.html"> full Chombo version</a> is given
here.   In this version, the Fortran interface is  done using
Chombo Fortran and we use the Chombo utilities for load balancing
and domain decomposition.
