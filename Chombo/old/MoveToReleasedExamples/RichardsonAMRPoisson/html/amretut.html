<h1>  AMRElliptic Example </h1>
<p>

We present an example of how to use the elliptic library
(AMRElliptic) in the Chombo distribution.

To compile this example, first change directory to
its executable directory.  
<pre>
<font face="Courier">
cd Chombo/example/AMRPoisson/exec
</font>
</pre>
Now edit the GNUmakefile.  The single line
you have to change is the first line which  looks like:
<pre>
<font face="Courier">
CHOMBO_HOME = ../../../lib
</font>
</pre>
Change the variable CHOMBO_HOME to the directory name where
you have installed Chombo/lib.   Then, in your shell, type 
<pre>
<font face="Courier">
make all
</font>
</pre>
This will produce an executable of the form "poisson(configurationstuff).ex".
The executable takes no one argument, its ParmParse inputs file.  
Just run it by typing in your shell
<pre>
<font face="Courier">
poisson(configurationstuff).ex input_file_name
</font>
</pre>
where inputs_file_name is the input file name.  A default input file
(called "inputs") is provided.

The example is split up into two pieces, the main routine and 
the utility functions.
<p>
The <a href="mainamre.html"> driving routine </a> is given
here.   This shows the basics of how to set up an elliptic operator
in the Chombo system and how to run the solver.
<p>
The <a href="amrefunc.html"> utility functions </a> show the
details of the same stuff.
