<h1>Chombo Parallel I/O with HDF5 Examples </h1>
<p>

We present two instances of how to do parallel
input/output in HDF5 using the  Chombo infrastructure.
The first is a simple domain-decomposition example which
outputs data from a single union of rectangles.  The
second outputs data from a complete adaptive hierarchy
of data.
To compile any of these examples, go into the 
appropriate directory 
<pre>
<font face="Courier">
cd Chombo/example/IO/AMR
</font>
</pre>
and edit GNUmakefile.  The single line
you have to change is the first line which  looks like:
<pre>
<font face="Courier">
CHOMBO_HOME = /home/graves/users/graves/_anag/_dev/Chombo/lib
</font>
</pre>
Change the variable CHOMBO_HOME to the directory name where
you have installed Chombo.   Then, in your shell, type 
<pre>
<font face="Courier">
make all
</font>
</pre>
This will produce an executable of the form "amrio(some other stuff).ex".
The executable takes no arguments.  Just run it by typing its name
in your shell.

<p>
The <a href="ugio.html"> uniform-grid version</a> is given
here.  This example breaks a single domain into a union of rectangles,
generates and outputs data over these grids.  It then reads 
the data back in and checks its correctness.
<p>
The <a href="amrio.html"> adaptive hierarchy version</a> is given
here.  This example generates a hierarchy of grids and data
over that hierarchy. It then outputs the data and reads
the data back in and checks its correctness.
