This program gives the correlation diagnostic.
It takes two HDF5 files of data on cells and writes out selected variables
on each cell, side by side, one per line.

To run:

./diagnostic...ex inputfile

where inputfile is the name of a file that contains the following settings:

diagnostic.exact = name of first HDF5 file
diagnostic.computed = name of second HDF5 file
diagnostic.output = root name of output files
diagnostic.var = list of variable names

There is a separate output file for each variable.
The name of each output file is
(root name of output files).(variable name).txt

If diagnostic.var is missing, then all variables in the two files
will be written out.
