This directory computes the norms in the NCAR test problem paper
http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cms/pel/tracer-workshop.html
Page 13, Appendix A: Standard error measures

These norms are, in order:
l1, l2, linf, phimax, phimin

To run:

./compare...ex inputfile

where inputfile has the format of inputs.compare.sameSize

or just do

./compare...ex /dev/null compare.error_var = scalar \
compare.exactRoot = exact.hdf5 compare.computedRoot = computed.hdf5 

to compare two files called exact.hdf5 and computed.hdf5
