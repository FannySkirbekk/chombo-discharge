This mini-app is for developers only, and is intended for bug testing ebconductivityop. 

The app has been set up so that there are no finer cells between the boundary and the EBCF interface - this implies that
the fine-level cells are update through ghost cells only, which appears to break the code completely.

Incidentally, multigrid does converge in the sense that the residual is sufficiently reduced, but the converged solution is obviously
nonphysical.
