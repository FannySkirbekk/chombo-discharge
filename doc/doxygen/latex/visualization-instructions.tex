The code writes its output files to H\+D\+F5. These files are portable, binary data files which require specialized visualization programs to plot. The recommended tool for this is to use Vis\+It visualization, which can be downloaded \href{https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit/executables}{\tt here}.

Three-\/dimensional data sets can become atrociously large. We are no strangers to data dumps in the range of tens of GB per time step; and local visualization of these are generally prohibitive.

Vis\+It can be run in server mode by allowing the local installation of Vis\+It to outsource the plot generation to a server. See
