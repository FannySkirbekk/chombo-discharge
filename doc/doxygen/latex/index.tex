PlasmaC is a scalable computer code for two-\/ and three-\/dimensional low-\/temperature fluid plasmas in complex geometries. We currently support


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Multi-\/material Poisson solvers
\item Diffusive radiate transport
\item Convection-\/diffusion reaction systems
\end{DoxyItemize}

PlasmaC is build on top of Chombo, and therefore features


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Cut-\/cell representation of geometries
\item Multi-\/material geometries (electrodes and insulators)
\item Patch-\/based adaptive mesh refinement
\item Excellent scalability to hundres of thousands of cores
\end{DoxyItemize}

Please see the \hyperlink{gallery}{gallery} for a selection of results

To get started, go \hyperlink{doxy-contents}{here}

You can obtain the PlasmaC from here\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}  git clone ssh://git@git.code.sintef.no/~robertm/chombo-streamer
\end{DoxyVerb}


If you do not have M\+F\+Chombo installed, it can be pulled from here\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}  git clone ssh://git@git.code.sintef.no/~robertm/mf-chombo
\end{DoxyVerb}
