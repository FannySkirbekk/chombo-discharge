\subsection*{T\+L\+DR }

Load the modules by \begin{DoxyVerb}module load intel/2017a
\end{DoxyVerb}


The configuration file for fram.\+sigma2.\+no can be found here. Store it as chombo\+\_\+root/lib/mk/\+Make.\+defs.\+local

\subsection*{Loading the modules }

To compile the system on the {\itshape fram} supercomputer, you need to load compilers and libraries before compiling the code. The intel compiler toochain is loaded by \begin{DoxyVerb}module load intel/2017a
\end{DoxyVerb}


which will load Intel compilers for Fortran and C/\+C++, as well as Intel M\+PI.

\subsection*{Modifying the configuration file }

The modify the configuration file, find the H\+D\+F5 path by \begin{DoxyVerb}module disp HDF5/1.10.1-intel-2017a
\end{DoxyVerb}


which will display the library paths to H\+D\+F5.

To use Intel\textquotesingle{}s Fortran and C/\+C++ compilers, please specify \begin{DoxyVerb} MPICXX = mpiicpc
 FC     = ifort
 CXX    = icpc
\end{DoxyVerb}


in Make.\+defs.\+local. Likewise, update Make.\+defs.\+local so that it finds the H\+D\+F5 libraries and include files.

We also recommend that you compile with -\/x\+C\+O\+R\+E-\/\+A\+V\+X2 (put it in cxxoptflags and foptflags) to enable advanced vector extensions.
