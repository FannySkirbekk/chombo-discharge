=======

PlasmaC features multiple discretizations of the CDR equations, and also contains interfaces for implementing new elliptic solvers, for example Poisson solvers or new radiative transport modules. Please see the :doxy:`Doxygen API <index>` for the interface into these solvers.

Below, we present a summary of the currently available solvers in PlasmaC.
