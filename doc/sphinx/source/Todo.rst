To-do list
-------------

* Average multi-valued cells in the multifluid Poisson operator
* Tag source terms using the curvature. Might be good for tagging streamer heads. 
* Clean up the polygonal tessellation stuff - the code is pretty dirty. 
* Test the BaseIF functionality fastIntersection to see if we can speed up the EBIS generation
* See if we can make a new geometryshop that takes a bounding box when doing makeGrids
