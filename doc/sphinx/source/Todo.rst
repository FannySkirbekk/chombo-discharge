To-do list
-------------

In order of priority

* Average multi-valued cells in the multifluid Poisson operator
* We should really have a multifluid AMG solver from PETSc as the bottom solver in multigrid
* Clean up the polygonal tessellation stuff - the code is pretty dirty, and probably even a bit buggy.
* See if we can make a new geometryshop that takes a bounding box when doing makeGrids
