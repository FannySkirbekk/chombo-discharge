To-do list
-------------

In order of priority

* Average multi-valued cells in the multifluid Poisson operator
* Couple the ``cdr_solver`` boundary conditions to the ``plasma_kinetics`` boundary conditions.
* Compute the charge flux through domain boundaries, this should be used for computing the external circuit current
* Clean up the polygonal tessellation stuff - the code is pretty dirty. 
* Test the BaseIF functionality fastIntersection to see if we can speed up the EBIS generation
* See if we can make a new geometryshop that takes a bounding box when doing makeGrids
* ``poisson_solver`` should compute the capacitance
