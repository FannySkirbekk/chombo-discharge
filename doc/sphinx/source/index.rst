Welcome to PlasmaC's user documentation!
========================================
	      
PlasmaC is a scalable computer code for two- and three-dimensional simulations of low-temperature fluid plasmas in complex geometries. PlasmaC supports

* Multi-material Poisson solvers
* Diffusion radiation transpor tsolvers
* Convection diffusion reaction systems

PlasmaC is built on top of Chombo, and therefore additionally features

* Cut-cell representation of multi-material geometries
* Patch based adaptive mesh refinement
* Excellent scalability from 1 to 100,000 cores.

Take a look at the gallery for some examples. 

This documentation is the user documentation for usage and examples on how to use PlasmaC. There is a separate :doxy:`Doxygen API <index>` documentation of the source code.
