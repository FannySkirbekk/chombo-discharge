**This is an alpha release of PlasmaC. Development is still in progress, and various bugs may or may not be present. User interfaces can and will change.**

Welcome to `PlasmaC`'s user documentation!
******************************************
	      
`PlasmaC` is a modular and scalable computer code for Cartesian two- and three-dimensional simulations of low-temperature plasmas in complex geometries.
`PlasmaC` evolves deterministic or fluctuating equations of hydrodynamics and features

* Electrostatics with support for electrodes and dielectrics
* Radiative transport as a diffusion or Monte Carlo process
* Scalar advection-diffusion-reaction transport in complex geometries, with support for fluctuating hydrodynamics
* ÃŽto particle models for microscopic drift-diffusion-reaction processes
* Parallel I/O with HDF5
* Sensible and simple-to-use physics interfaces
* Various time integration schemes

Numerical solvers are designed to run on their own, but are best used through physics interfaces.

For scalability, `PlasmaC` is built on top of `Chombo <https://commons.lbl.gov/display/chombo/Chombo+-+Software+for+Adaptive+Solutions+of+Partial+Differential+Equations>`_, and therefore additionally features

* Cut-cell representation of multi-material geometries
* Patch based adaptive mesh refinement
* Good weak and strong scalability to thousands of computer cores

Our goal is that users will be able to use `PlasmaC` without modifying the underlying solvers.
There are interfaces for describing the plasma physics, setting up boundary conditions, ensuring mesh refinement, and so on.
As `PlasmaC` evolves, so will these interfaces.
We aim for (but cannot guarantee) backward compatibility such that existing `PlasmaC` models can be run on future versions. 
This documentation is the user documentation `PlasmaC`. There is a separate :doxy:`Doxygen API <index>` that can be compiled together with the source code.
