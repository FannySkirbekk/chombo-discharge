Visualization
=============

PlasmaC writes it's output files to HDF5. In general, user's can decide what data to output, as well as restrict plot depth to a certain AMR level. There are also options for including ghost cells in the output files.

Our favorite tool for visualization is `VisIt <https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/visit/VisIt>`_, which can be freely downloaded. The VisIt documentation is found `here <http://visit-sphinx-user-manual.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_
