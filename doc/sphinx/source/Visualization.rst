Visualization
=============

`PlasmaC` output files are written to HDF5 files in the format ``<simulation_name>.step#.dimension.hdf5`` and the files will be written to the directory specified by :ref:`plasma_engine` runtime parameters. Currently, we have only used VisIt for visualizing the plot files.
