.. _Chap:GettingStarted:

Getting started
===============

If you have not used PlasmaC before, we recommend that you begin by reading the :ref:`Chap:Interface` chapter. Here, you will also find information on the :ref:`Chap:PythonInterface`.

To get started using PlasmaC, we recommend that you follow the :ref:`Chap:WorkedExample` chapter. This example will provide the entire workflow from generating a geometry, setting up your mini-app, and running it. For information on how to set up your environment so that PlasmaC can be compiled, see :ref:`Chap:Compiling`

If you are already using PlasmaC, and want to check out what various parameters in your input script do, check out the :ref:`Chap:ImportantClasses` chapter.
