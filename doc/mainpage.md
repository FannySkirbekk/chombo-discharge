PlasmaC is a scalable computer code for two- and three-dimensional low-temperature fluid plasmas in complex geometries. The current version of the code solves for coupled systems of Poisson's equation, convection-diffusion-reaction equations, and diffusive radiative transport solvers.

PlasmaC is build on top of Chombo, and therefore features

  * Cut-cell representation of geometries
  * Multi-material geometries (electrodes and insulators)
  * Patch-based adaptive mesh refinement
  * Excellent scalability to hundres of thousands of cores

You can obtain the code from here:

      git clone ssh://git@git.code.sintef.no/~robertm/chombo-streamer
