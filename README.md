This is code PlasmaC, a multiphysics code built in Chombo for plasma
simulations with adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) on embedded boundary
grids.

The basic requirements for running this code are:

1. A working MPI installation
2. A working HDF5 installation (with MPI)

A modified version of Chombo is distributed together with this code.
PlasmaC only uses Chombo; it is not affiliated nor endorsed by LBNL.
